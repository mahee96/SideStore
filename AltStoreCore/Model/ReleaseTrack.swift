/// ReleaseTrack manages the categorization of AppVersions into different release channels (alpha/beta/stable).
///
/// Design Notes:
/// - ReleaseTrack is owned by StoreAppV2 with cascade deletion
/// - AppVersion can belong to only one ReleaseTrack at a time
/// - AppVersion is categorized into one of three channels (alpha/beta/stable)
/// - This is a "categorized one-to-many" relationship, not a true many-to-many
///   as AppVersions are dependent entities owned by their StoreApp/ReleaseTrack
///
/// Relationship Maintenance:
/// - Due to the categorized nature of relationships (alpha/beta/stable),
///   CoreData cannot automatically maintain inverse relationships
/// - Manual relationship maintenance is required during merges (see MergePolicy)
/// - When moving versions between channels, ensure both sides of relationship are updated
///
